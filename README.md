## Challenge #1

A 3-tier environment is a common setup. Use a tool of your choosing/familiarity create these resources on a cloud environment (GCP Cloud). 

Please remember we will not be judged on the outcome but more focusing on the approach, style and reproducibility.
 
## Challenge #2

We need to write code that will query the meta data of an instance within GCP and provide a json formatted output. 
The choice of language and implementation is up to you.

### Bonus Points

The code allows for a particular data key to be retrieved individually

## Challenge #3

We have a nested object. We would like a function where you pass in the object and any key and get back the value. 
The choice of language and implementation is up to you.

Example Input

object = {"a":{"b":{"c":"d"}}}

key = a/b/c

object = {"x":{"y":{"z":"a"}}}

key = x/y/z

value = a
